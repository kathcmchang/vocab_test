# HKEB Vocabulary Test Web Application
# Introduction and Background
The HKEB Vocabulary Test Web Application is designed as a standardized vocabulary test based on word lists provided by the Hong Kong Education Bureau. The project consists of four test categories targeting primary 1-3, primary 4-6, secondary 1-3, and secondary 4-6 levels, respectively. The application utilizes visual aids and multimedia, which have been proven to enhance content absorption and learner interaction in ESL classrooms (Halwani, 2017). For primary levels, we've incorporated pictures with the vocabulary, practicing traditional picture-naming tasks. For secondary levels, we've adopted Chinese translation equivalents (TEs), given the higher language abilities among these students.

# Word Selection
We have manually selected 70 words suitable for vocabulary tests from each word list. The selection process involved omitting auxiliaries, copular verbs, terminologies, rare or abstract nouns and verbs. We also excluded words with less than three letters in levels 3 and 4. We replaced some Chinese TEs with more suitable and commonly utilized lexical items in Hong Kong written Chinese to optimize the translation tasks.

# Vocabulary Tests
The application hosts vocabulary tests with varying formats depending on the level:

- Level 1: The test includes 30 randomized multiple-choice questions based on pictures. Students have two chances to answer each question with a point deducted for a second attempt.

- Level 2: The test is divided into two parts, both incorporating pictures. Part 1 involves multiple-choice questions while part 2 requires students to translate the depicted entity into English.

- Level 3: Test takers fill in English translations of Chinese words among four given options. They can decide to show or hide the options, and the use of this aid doesn't contribute to the score calculation.

- Level 4: Students translate Chinese words into English, with hints provided optionally that deduct points upon usage.

A score is calculated to track progress. To pass the tests, students must correctly answer a minimum number of questions within a set time limit of 15 minutes. Upon passing, students are automatically redirected to the next level. Students scoring 90% or above in level 4 will receive an e-certificate.

# Target Audience and Game Design
Our target audience consists of children and teenagers. To make the tests more engaging, we've included features such as gif images and a pastel-colored design with a contemporary font. Additionally, we've created a translation game themed on animal names to provide a relaxing yet educational break from the tests.
